  This archive contains OCaml bindings for the
  Chipmunk 2D physics library.

    http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk


  The Makefile assuses Chipmunk is installed in
    /usr/local/lib/libchipmunk.so
  and that the header files are located in
    /usr/local/include/chipmunk/

  If these are in other (not compatible) directories,
  edit the Makefile to fix the path.

  run 'make' to compile the binding, and 'make test'
  to launch the "moon buggy" demo.

  The demo riquire the OpenGL binding called glMLite,
  which can be found at:
    http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/GL/

  run 'make doc' to generate the interface ocamldoc
  documentation. Two interfaces are provided, a High
  level object oriented one, and a low level one.

  The commented demo 'moon_buggy.ml' uses the High 
  level interface, and the demo 'demo_dist.ml' uses
  the low level one.

  You can choose between two available installations.
  'make install' will apply a manual installation, and
  'make install_findlib' for the findlib users.
  With the last one, you can compile stuff with:
    ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -package chipmunk foo.ml
  With manual install, just:
    ocamlc -I +chipmunk chipmunk.cma foo.ml

  You can use this binding, either under the terms
  of the GPL licence, or at your option, along
  the terms of the Expat/X11 licence. You can find
  conditions of these licences in the files:
    LICENCE_GPL.txt  and  LICENCE_MIT.txt
